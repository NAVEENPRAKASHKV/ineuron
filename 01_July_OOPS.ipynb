    "1.What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to facilitate the design, development, and maintenance of software by organizing data and functionality into reusable, self-contained units called objects. OOP is based on a set of principles and concepts that promote a structured and modular approach to software development. The key goals of OOP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: OOP encourages breaking down a complex system into smaller, manageable units (objects) that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This modular approach makes it easier to understand and work with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability:OOP promotes the creation of objects that encapsulate both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). These objects can be reused in different parts of the program or in other programs, reducing redundancy and saving development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (an object). It restricts direct access to an object's internal data and allows controlled access through well-defined interfaces. This helps in maintaining data integrity and reduces unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes and objects based on real-world entities. It allows developers to focus on the essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details, making the code more understandable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:Inheritance allows you to create new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). It promotes code reuse by inheriting attributes and methods from a parent class while allowing customization and extension in child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism:Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This enables flexibility in handling various objects through a unified interface, making the code more adaptable and extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these goals, OOP aims to make software development more efficient, maintainable, and adaptable. It promotes a structured and organized approach to designing and building software systems, which can lead to better code quality and easier collaboration among developers."

    "2.What is an object in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept and is at the core of the language's design. Almost everything in Python is an object. An object is an instance of a class, and it can represent data and behaviors associated with that class. Here are some key characteristics of objects in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of Classes:In Python, objects are instances of classes. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. You create objects by instantiating classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes:Objects can have attributes, which are variables that store data associated with the object. These attributes are defined within the class and are accessible using the dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:Objects can have methods, which are functions that are defined within the class and can be called on the object. Methods define the behavior of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity:Each object in Python has a unique identity, which is assigned when the object is created. You can check the identity of an object using the id() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type:Objects have a type, which corresponds to the class they belong to. You can check the type of an object using the `type()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and Behavior Encapsulation:Objects encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) within a single unit, following the principles of encapsulation in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of creating an object in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects of that class will have.

    "Constructor:The constructor method, typically named __init__, is a special method used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created. It is called automatically when you create a new object from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self:The self parameter in class methods refers to the instance of the object itself. It is used to access and modify attributes and call other methods within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:Inheritance allows you to create new classes (child classes or subclasses) based on existing classes (parent classes or base classes). Child classes inherit attributes and methods from their parent classes and can also override or extend them.\n",

    "4.What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, classes are used as blueprints to create objects (instances) that share common attributes and methods. Attributes and methods are key components of a class, and they define the behavior and state of objects created from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attributes:\n",
    "   - Attributes, also known as properties or fields, are variables that store data associated with an object. They represent the state or characteristics of the object. Attributes define what an object \"has.\"\n",
    "   - Attributes can have different data types, including integers, strings, floats, or custom objects.\n",

    "5.What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both class variables and instance variables are used to store data within a class, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class Variables:\n",
    "   - Class variables are shared among all instances (objects) of a class. They are associated with the class itself rather than with specific instances of the class.\n",
    "   - They are defined within the class but outside of any instance methods, typically at the top of the class definition.\n",
    "   - Class variables are often used to store data that is common to all instances of the class. For example, a class variable could be used to store a constant value shared by all objects of that class.\n",
    "   - Class variables are accessed using the class name or the instance name, but when accessed via an instance, they refer to the same variable shared across all instances.\n",
    "   - Modifying a class variable through one instance will npt affects all other instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    #Class variable\n",
    "    pi = 3.14159\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        #Instance variable\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "#Creating instances of the Circle class\n",
    "circle1 = Circle(5)\n",
    "circle2 = Circle(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Accessing the class variable using class name\n",
    "print(Circle.pi)  # Output: 3.14159\n",
    "\n",
    "#Modifying the class variable through one instance\n",
    "circle1.pi = 3.14\n",
    "\n",
    "#Accessing the modified class variable through an instance\n",
    "print(circle1.pi)  # Output: 3.14 (Specific to circle1)\n",
    "print(circle2.pi)  # Output: 3.14159 (Not affected by the modification)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Accessing the class variable using the class name\n",
    "print(Circle.pi)  # Output: 3.14159 (Unaffected by the modification)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instance Variables:\n",
    "   - Instance variables are specific to each instance (object) of a class. They are defined within the class's methods, typically within the __init__ constructor method.\n",
    "   - Instance variables represent the unique state or attributes of each object created from the class.\n",
    "   - They are accessed and modified using the dot notation on a specific instance of the class.\n",
    "   - Each instance has its own separate copy of instance variables, and changes to one instance's variables do not affect other instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        #Instance variables\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "#Creating instances of the Person class\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "person2 = Person(\"Bob\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Accessing instance variables\n",
    "print(person1.name, person1.age)  # Output: Alice 30\n",
    "print(person2.name, person2.age)  # Output: Bob 25\n",
    "\n",
    "#Modifying instance variables\n",
    "person1.age = 32\n",
    "print(person1.age)  # Output: 32 (Only person1's age is changed)\n",
    "print(person2.age)  # Output: 25 (person2's age remains unaffected)\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are typically used for storing data that is common to all instances. Instance variables are specific to each instance and represent the unique state of each object created from the class. Understanding when to use each type of variable is essential for effective object-oriented programming in Python."

    "6.What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the self parameter in class methods serves several important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Instance Variables: self refers to the specific instance of the class that the method is called on. It allows you to access and work with instance variables, which are variables that hold data specific to each instance of the class. This enables you to read or modify the state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Other Instance Methods: With self, you can call other methods within the same class, including other instance methods. This helps organize and encapsulate functionality related to the class within its methods, making the code more modular and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining Object State: self helps maintain the state of an object. It ensures that data associated with one instance of the class does not interfere with data associated with other instances. Each instance has its own copy of instance variables and can maintain its unique state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating and Managing Multiple Instances: Python is an object-oriented language, and classes are used to create objects (instances). self distinguishes one instance from another. When you create multiple instances of a class, each instance uses self to access its own data and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate these purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        #Instance variables specific to each dog\n",

    "        print(f\"{self.name} barks loudly!\")\n",

    "    def introduce(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"My name is {self.name}, and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#Creating two instances of the Dog class\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Accessing instance variables and calling methods using self\n",
    "dog1.bark()        # Output: Buddy barks loudly!\n",
    "dog2.introduce()   # Output: My name is Max, and I am 5 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, self is used to access and manipulate the instance variables self.name and self.age. It is also used to call the bark and introduce methods, allowing each instance to behave differently based on its own data.In summary, self is a convention in Python to reference the instance itself within class methods, allowing for object-specific data and behavior."
